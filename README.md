# Shopify Merchant Dashboard Challenge
Welcome to the Shopify Merchant Dashboard Challenge! In this challenge, you will be tasked with implementing various features and interactions for the Shopify merchant dashboard based on the provided user stories and Figma designs.

### Challenge Overview
As a participant in this challenge, your goal is to create a responsive and accessible merchant dashboard for Shopify. The primary features and interactions include:

### Navigation:

Clicking on the Shopify icon in the top bar should redirect the merchant to the Shopify landing page (shopify.com).
Focusing on the search box allows the merchant to freely type into the input without triggering any further actions.
### Notification Panel:

Clicking on the notification bell reveals a dropdown panel with an empty list of notifications.
Clicking the notification bell again closes the dropdown panel.
### Profile Menu:

Clicking on the store name or profile image placeholder opens a menu with specified items.
Clicking again closes the menu.
Clicking on any menu item redirects the merchant to admin.shopify.com.
Select Plan Link:

Clicking on the "Select plan" link redirects the merchant to the Shopify pricing page (shopify.com/pricing).
### Trial Callout Dismissal:

Clicking the dismiss button of the trial callout immediately removes it from the page.
### Setup Guide Card:

Clicking the "Arrow Up" icon on the Setup guide card closes and reopens the card.
### Onboarding Steps:

Clicking on any of the 5 onboarding steps expands the panel, showing step content, and closes any previously opened step.
Clicking on an already opened step has no effect.
Clicking on the checkbox marks a step as completed, expanding the next incomplete step.
Onboarding Progress Bar:

Marking steps as completed or incomplete updates the onboarding progress bar accordingly.
